# Kubeopera by Ochestra - a Unified Cloud-Native Infrastructure Management & Optimization Platform

Ochestra presents Kubeopera, A light-weight  cloud-native application orchestration and management platform tool, that automates the complete Kubernetes lifecycle, from provisioning and application deployment to troubleshooting, security, and cost optimization. The tool would enable organizations to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve reliability while maintaining optimum workload performance.

## System Overview

### Purpose

The tool provides a complete solution for managing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing Kubernetes environments across multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premises deployments. It eliminates the need for multiple disparate tools, reduces complexity, and lowers the operational burden on DevOps and platform engineering teams.


## System Architecture
